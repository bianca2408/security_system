The purpose of this project is to create an optimized security system to prevent false alarms. The principle on which this optimization is based is the interdependence of motion sensors with pressure sensors. A 3D Model of a house for the presentation was also created and printed with a 3D Printer.
Software technologies used: Arduino IDE, Autocad, SketchUp, Flashprint (software used for printing on 3D Printer Flashforge Creator 3).
Hardware technologies used: Arduino UNO, PIR Sensors, Analog Pressure Sensors, Buzzer, Resistors and Cables.

 The pressure sensors were placed strategically to detect potential intruders. These are located in the floors of each monitored room, while the PIR sensors were installed in the walls of the monitored rooms. Their role is to detect the movements of potential intruders.

 How it works: the alarm is activated when a foreign presence is detected in at least one of the monitored rooms. To detect this presence, it is necessary for both the motion sensor and the pressure sensor to be activated simultaneously. This helps us avoid the occurrence of false alarms. Another important benefit of this methodology is the ability to accurately inform the client where the security breach occurred (through which room it entered). This does not prevent the system from being triggered for all rooms if necessary.
